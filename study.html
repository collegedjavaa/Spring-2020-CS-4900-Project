        <hr>
        
        <p>Here below is how the program works in general:</p>
        
        <p>Our major program base is Nanjing University, in Nanjing, by the famous Yangtze River, a bit over one hour away from Shanghai by high-speed trains.</p>
        
        <p>Before arriving in Nanjing, students start with tours in Beijing and Xi'an so as to get a good sense of Chinese history, economy and society. Following that, the program stays in Nanjing for about 1-3 weeks to have classes and side trips (if they so choose). After Nanjing, the travel agencies will take students on tours to Suzhou, and finally students conclude their study-in-China-program in Shanghai.</p>

        <h2>Studying at Nanjing University</h2>
        
        <p>Nanjing is a famous historical city, with rich cultural heritage. It was the capital of 10 ancient dynasties. The city is well known for its beautiful scenic sites, food, and hospitable people. It is also a very important education center of China, with dozens of prestigious colleges and universities, with Nanjing University being one of the top five universities in China.</p>
        
        <p>In Nanjing, the program stays in a very comfortable hotelon the campus of Nanjing University and close to many other universities. It is right in the center of the city, in an area with many restaurants, tea houses, coffee shops, bookstores, museums, Buddhist and Daoist temples, hospitals, supermarkets, up-scale shopping malls, cinemas, and nightclubs.</p>
