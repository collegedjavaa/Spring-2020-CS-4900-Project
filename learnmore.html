        <h1>Welcome</h1>
    
        <p>The US-China Education Council is committed to promoting cross-cultural understanding and educational exchanges between United States and China. For this purpose, we organize programs that allow participants to visit, observe, and experience a different culture. If you want to visit China, teach or study in China, we are here to help.</p>
        <p>With a cultural tradition of over 5,000 years, many renowned sites and beautiful scenery, China has a lot to offer to Americans. And the United States, with its democratic system, advanced technology and best educational resources, also holds special charm for the Chinese.</p>
        <p>Check programs that interest you. We look forward to assisting you.</p>
    
        <h2>Enjoy Our Programs in China</h2>
        
        <p>Teaching and studying in China, for one semester or one year, will provide opportunities to learn the Chinese language, make friends with the locals, and have a more in-depth understanding of Chinese culture.</p>

        <p>And attending China tours is a common way for Americans to see, and learn about, China. Since 2002, every year, we have been organizing China tours for educators, students, and colleagues from other different professions.</p>
